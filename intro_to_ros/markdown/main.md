## Introduction
This document provides a very brief introduction to Robotics Operating System (ROS) and some of its components.
The target audience of this document are the students of the Experimental Robotics course MTRX5700 at the University of Sydney.
This document also assumes that the reader is an absolute beginner to ROS and has minimal understanding of Linux build systems.
This means that quite a few techincal details are skipped in favour of providing a high level understanding. 
Wherever possible, links to technical content are provided.
As a result, while this document provides the reader with sufficient knowledge to start working with robots, it is in no way a comprehensive guide on ROS.
